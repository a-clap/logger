= Logger
:toc: left

Logger package for private use.

== What is this?

Simple logger package (mainly interface for zap/maybe something else in future) which I use in my own code.

== How to use it?

Here You have primitive snippet

[source,go]
----
package main

import (
	"github.com/a-clap/logger"
	"go.uber.org/zap/zapcore"
)

func main() {
	logger.Init(logger.NewDefaultZap(zapcore.DebugLevel))
	log := logger.Get()
	log.Debug("Hello world!")
}
----

You will see colored output in console like

[source]
----
2022-08-19 21:21:20.955 DEBUG   cmd/main.go:16  hello world!
